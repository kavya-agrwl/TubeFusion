Technologies

React JS
Description: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by Facebook. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.
Usage in Tube Fusion: React is used to build the entire front-end of Tube Fusion. The component-based architecture of React helps in creating reusable UI components, making the development process more efficient and the codebase easier to maintain. State management and lifecycle methods provided by React are utilized to handle dynamic data and user interactions seamlessly.


Material UI 5
Description: Material UI is a popular React UI framework that implements Google's Material Design guidelines. It provides a wide range of pre-designed components and styles that can be easily integrated into React applications to create aesthetically pleasing and responsive user interfaces.
Usage in Tube Fusion: Material UI is used to design the user interface of Tube Fusion, providing a consistent and visually appealing look and feel. Components such as AppBar, Card, Grid, and Button are used extensively to build the layout and functionality of the application. The use of Material UI's theming capabilities ensures a cohesive design across the application.


RapidAPI
Description: RapidAPI is a platform that allows developers to discover, connect to, and manage APIs. It provides a marketplace where APIs from various providers are available, enabling developers to integrate third-party services into their applications easily.
Usage in Tube Fusion: RapidAPI is utilized to fetch video data from an external API. By subscribing to a video data API on RapidAPI, Tube Fusion retrieves video information, search results, and related video data. This integration allows Tube Fusion to provide up-to-date and relevant content to users without having to manage the data internally.














# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
